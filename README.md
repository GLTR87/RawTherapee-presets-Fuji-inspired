# RawTherapee-presets-Fuji-inspired
Presets inspired by the Fuji film simulator modes, to be used on RAW files with RawTherapee.

Make sure you reset your picture with RT's "neutral" preset before applying the FX presets. No need to reset between FX presets.

What is affected by those presets:
-Custom tone curves.
-HSV curves.
-Black & White. Desaturation for Acros and Monochrome.
-Basic sharpening.
-Automatic chroma noise reduction.

The goal with these presets is to be able to apply them to any RAW picture and be done with it, or close to.

The presets were calibrated with a Sony A7 camera, but they give good results with Canon 5D and Olympus X-Z1 RAW files, and probably others.
